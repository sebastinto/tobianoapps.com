## **Privacy Policy**

[Tobiano Apps](https://www.tobianoapps.com/) built the Sunny Side app as a Free app. This Service is provided by [Tobiano Apps](https://www.tobianoapps.com/) at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use this app.

If you choose to use this Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at [https://www.tobianoapps.com/android/sunnyside/legal/terms.html](https://www.tobianoapps.com/android/sunnyside/legal/terms.html) unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

### **Information Collection and Use**

For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that we request will be retained on your device and is not collected by us in any way.

The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

### **Log Data**

Although we do not collect any log data, we want to inform you that whenever you use this Service, in a case of an error in the app, third-party products (like the Google Play Store) may collect data and information on your phone. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing this Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

Sunny Side stores your location on your device only. It is not used for ads or analytics. However, the app needs to communicate your location to the [Meteorologisk Institute's](https://www.met.no/) API to get UV index data back. Please refer to their [privacy policy](https://www.met.no/en/About-us/privacy). Also, getting your location either through a location request via GPS or via the [Google Places SDK](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/places) shares some of your data with Google. Please refer to [Google's privacy policy center](https://policies.google.com/privacy) to learn more.

Location access is necessary to locate your position and retrieve UV index data. Background location access is required to refresh your location and UV index data when you use widgets. In order to update widgets, Sunny Side may access your location even when the app is closed or not in use.

### **Cookies**

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

### **Service Providers**

We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

*   To facilitate our Service;
*   To provide the Service on our behalf;
*   To perform Service-related services; or
*   To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

### **Security**

We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### **Links to Other Sites**

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

### **Children’s Privacy**

In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.
